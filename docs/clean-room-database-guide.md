# Clean Room Database Guide

You have 512 weight entries in your Room database that need to be cleaned up. Here are several methods to delete them:

## Method 1: Use Existing Debug Methods (Safest)

### Option A: Temporary Debug Button

Add this temporary button to any screen (like SimpleProgressTrackingScreen):

```kotlin
// Add this temporarily to SimpleProgressTrackingScreen.kt in the actions section
IconButton(onClick = {
    // Delete all entries from both Room and Firestore
    viewModel.deleteAllWeightEntriesGlobal()
}) {
    Icon(Icons.Default.DeleteForever, contentDescription = "Clean DB")
}
```

### Option B: Use Android Studio Debugger

1. Set a breakpoint in your ProfileViewModel or any ViewModel
2. In the debugger console, run:

```kotlin
// For current user only
databaseDebugger.deleteAllWeightEntriesWithFirestore(userId)

// For all users (cleans everything)
databaseDebugger.deleteAllWeightEntriesGlobalWithFirestore()
```

## Method 2: ADB Commands (Now Available!)

**‚úÖ ADB is now in your PATH!** You can use these commands directly:

### Check if your device is connected:

```bash
adb devices
```

### Find your app package name:

```bash
adb shell pm list packages | findstr diet
```

### Delete entire Room database (nuclear option):

```bash
# Stop the app first
adb shell am force-stop com.dietapp

# Delete the database files
adb shell "run-as com.dietapp rm -rf /data/data/com.dietapp/databases/"

# Or just delete the specific database
adb shell "run-as com.dietapp rm /data/data/com.dietapp/databases/diet_app_database*"
```

### Delete specific table data using SQLite:

```bash
# Connect to database
adb shell "run-as com.dietapp sqlite3 /data/data/com.dietapp/databases/diet_app_database"

# Then run SQL commands:
DELETE FROM weight_entries;
VACUUM;
.quit
```

### Quick app data reset:

```bash
adb shell pm clear com.dietapp
```

## Method 3: Database Inspector (Android Studio)

1. Open **Android Studio**
2. Go to **View ‚Üí Tool Windows ‚Üí App Inspection**
3. Select your running app
4. Click **Database Inspector**
5. Navigate to **diet_app_database ‚Üí weight_entries**
6. You can manually delete entries or run SQL:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM weight_entries;
   ```

## Method 4: Programmatic Solution

Add this method to your WeightTrackingViewModel temporarily:

```kotlin
fun nukeDatabaseEmergency() {
    viewModelScope.launch {
        try {
            println("üö® EMERGENCY: Starting nuclear database cleanup")

            // Delete from Firestore first
            val firestoreDeleted = weightRepository.deleteAllWeightEntriesGlobalWithFirestore()
            println("üî• Deleted $firestoreDeleted entries from Firestore")

            // Double-check Room deletion
            val roomDeleted = weightRepository.deleteAllWeightEntriesGlobal()
            println("üíæ Deleted $roomDeleted entries from Room")

            // Verify cleanup
            val remaining = weightRepository.getAllWeightEntriesDebug()
            println("‚úÖ Remaining entries: ${remaining.size}")

            if (remaining.isEmpty()) {
                println("üéâ SUCCESS: Database completely cleaned!")
            } else {
                println("‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: ${remaining.size} entries still remain")
            }

        } catch (e: Exception) {
            println("üí• ERROR: Database cleanup failed: ${e.message}")
            e.printStackTrace()
        }
    }
}
```

Then call it from a temporary button:

```kotlin
Button(onClick = { viewModel.nukeDatabaseEmergency() }) {
    Text("üö® NUKE DATABASE")
}
```

## Method 5: App Data Reset (Simplest)

### Via Android Settings:

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí DietApp**
2. Click **Storage & cache**
3. Click **Clear storage** (this resets everything)

### Via ADB:

```bash
adb shell pm clear com.dietapp
```

## Recommended Approach

1. **First, try Method 1 (debug methods)** - safest and uses your existing code
2. **If that doesn't work, try Method 3 (Database Inspector)** - visual and controlled
3. **If you're comfortable with command line, use Method 2 (ADB)** - most direct
4. **Last resort: Method 5 (clear app data)** - nuclear option but guaranteed to work

## Verification Steps

After cleaning:

1. **Check Database Inspector**: Should show 0 entries in weight_entries table
2. **Check Firestore Console**: Should show no documents in WeightEntries collection
3. **Open your app**: Should show empty weight tracking screen
4. **Add a test entry**: Should work normally and sync to Firestore

## Prevention

To prevent this from happening again:

1. Always use the **Firestore-aware delete methods** (`deleteAllWeightEntriesWithFirestore`)
2. Test delete operations on a small dataset first
3. Monitor both Room and Firestore after delete operations
4. Consider adding a "Delete confirmation" with entry count display

## Your Current Situation

- **Room Database**: 512 weight_entries (orphaned data)
- **Firestore**: 11 WeightEntries (recent synced data)
- **Goal**: Clean Room database, keep Firestore minimal

**Recommended**: Use Method 1, Option A with the deleteAllWeightEntriesGlobalWithFirestore() method to clean both databases simultaneously.
