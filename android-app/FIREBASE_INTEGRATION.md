# Firebase Integration Summary

## Overview

The Diet App has been successfully integrated with Firebase to provide cloud-based data storage, real-time synchronization, user authentication, and push notifications. This integration fulfills functional requirements FR8.1-FR8.3 and FR9.1-FR9.3.

## Firebase Services Implemented

### 1. Firebase Authentication (FR8.1)

- **Service**: `FirebaseAuthService`
- **Features**:
  - Email/password authentication
  - Anonymous user support
  - Session management
  - Multi-device login

### 2. Firebase Firestore (FR8.1, FR8.2)

- **Repositories**:
  - `FirebaseUserRepository` - User profiles and weight data
  - `FirebaseFoodRepository` - Food database and meal logs
- **Collections**:
  - `users` - User profiles and settings
  - `weight_entries` - Weight tracking data
  - `food_items` - Main food database
  - `user_foods` - User-created foods
  - `food_logs` - Meal logging entries

### 3. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FR8.3, FR9.1-FR9.3)

- **Service**: `FirebaseMessagingService`
- **Features**:
  - Meal reminder notifications
  - Weight tracking reminders
  - Achievement notifications
  - Progress update alerts
  - Customizable notification preferences

## Data Synchronization Strategy

### Dual Storage Architecture

- **Local (Room)**: Offline support and fast access
- **Cloud (Firestore)**: Real-time sync and backup
- **Sync Process**: Bidirectional with conflict resolution

### Real-time Updates

- Live data streams using Firestore listeners
- Automatic UI updates when data changes
- Multi-device synchronization

## Notification System

### Notification Types

1. **Meal Reminders** - Breakfast, lunch, dinner times
2. **Weight Reminders** - Weekly check-in prompts
3. **Achievements** - Goal completion celebrations
4. **Progress Updates** - Weekly summary reports
5. **Meal Suggestions** - Personalized meal recommendations

### Notification Channels

- `meal_reminders` - Daily meal notifications
- `achievements` - Goal completion alerts
- `progress_updates` - Weekly insights
- `general` - App announcements

### User Preferences

- Customizable reminder times
- Notification type toggles
- Quiet hours configuration
- Topic subscription management

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection

- Firebase security rules restrict data access
- User-specific data isolation
- Encrypted data transmission
- GDPR compliance features

### Authentication Security

- Firebase Auth with token refresh
- Secure session management
- Anonymous account support
- Account deletion capabilities

## Implementation Files

### Core Firebase Services

- `FirebaseConfig.kt` - Firebase initialization
- `FirebaseAuthService.kt` - Authentication management
- `FirebaseUserRepository.kt` - User and weight data
- `FirebaseFoodRepository.kt` - Food and meal data
- `FirebaseMessagingService.kt` - Push notifications
- `NotificationRepository.kt` - Notification preferences

### Data Mapping

- `FirebaseMappers.kt` - Firestore document conversion
- Type-safe mapping between Firestore and app models
- Null safety and error handling

### Dependency Injection

- `FirebaseModule.kt` - Hilt module for Firebase dependencies
- Singleton instances for optimal performance
- Proper lifecycle management

## Setup Requirements

### Firebase Project Configuration

1. Create Firebase project
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password, Anonymous)
3. Enable Firestore with security rules
4. Enable Cloud Messaging
5. Download `google-services.json`

### Security Rules Example (Firestore)

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    match /weight_entries/{entryId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }

    // Public food database (read-only)
    match /food_items/{foodId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
